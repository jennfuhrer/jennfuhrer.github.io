For the 5-week final design project for Cornell's ECE class Design Using Microcontrollers (ECE 4760), my two partners and I made a gesture rhythm game called Groovy Times. It incorporated PIC32 microcontrollers, Arduino Unos, RF radios, and an accelerometer. The game displayed a sequence of movements that your hand would have to mimic to score points (recorded by the accelerometer), similar to the game Dance Dance Revolution. The display and gesture recording modules were wireless from one another utilizing RF radios to communicate.
