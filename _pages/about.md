# Experience Summary
In high school, my passion for math and science led me to try my local technical school's engineering program. During my time on the team, I was a part of Loudoun County's FIRST Robotics Competition team [5338 "RoboLoCo"](http://team5338.org/). Our experience qualifying to go the national championship (and having [our qualifying robot stolen!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/04/14/robot-stolen-in-tennessee-turns-up-but-its-found-just-too-late-for-loudoun-team/)) was one of the reasons I went on to pursue a career in software engineering. I continued my robotics experience into college when I went to Cornell University. I joined the project team [CUAUV](https://cuauv.org/) and was able to contribute to both the mechanical and electrical systems.

After graduating in 2019, I joined [Grier Forensics](https://www.grierforensics.com/) as a Software Engineer. I worked on command and control network infrastructure for airborne networks as well as implementing a CLI to interact with the system at large. In this role, I was also introduced to government proposal writing where I wrote and contributed to a handful of SBIR submitted proposals.

Once the project's contract had been completed, I moved on to [Two Six Technologies](https://twosixtech.com/) and within a year was promoted to a Senior Software Engineer. I led TST's efforts on a DARPA project called [SocialCyber](https://www.darpa.mil/program/hybrid-ai-to-protect-integrity-of-open-source-code) to prototype the visualization of a suite of Machine Learning tools trained to parse social artifacts of GitHub users interacting and contributing to open source software projects. In addition to my role on the SocialCyber team, I led efforts to submit a proposal to develop a Python-based 5G testing tool, and I currently perform cellular (2G/4G) testing and data analysis/visualization on embedded devices. For more information about the tasks I performed and the technologies I worked with, see the experience section below or my resume in the Contact section.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, painting, drawing, and making gadgets/trinkets. I am an active member of [NOVA Labs](https://www.nova-labs.org/), a community makerspace, where I work on jewelry and small woodworking projects.

My professional and hobby work has been varied and extensive for someone of my experience level because I enjoy breaking down different types of problems. I am capable of solving them in concrete and common sense ways which inspires me to be curious to learn new and old technologies. While my experience and interest has been in **Data Engineering** and **Embedded Systems**, I am open to new and diverse experiences that lead to a positive impact for myself and my community.
